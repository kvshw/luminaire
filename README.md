# Luminaire Project

This is created as a project for Helvar. The guidelines are to create this as a react project and try to have same functionalities and styles they have provided. It seems interesting and have some exciting points. You can read more while the project is on the go and completed.

## Problems Facing & Progress

(15.07.2023)

- Am I going to create the functionality by myself, or will I use some UI libraries like Material UI or Chakra UI? Which library is best for this project
- Then I selected Material UI first to try, and currently having the problem of making the 0-1 mark wider because the 0-1 change is not noticeable as the project requirements.

(19.07.2023)

- In the past few days I tried to use few UI libraries and choose Material UI because it's under MIT.
- Then I had problem with how to get the same visible width as 5-10 to be equal to 0-1 then Finally I did Value mapping. 0 - 0/ 1-1/ then 2-5.
- It is working fine and I completed the slider changing according to the requirenments.

(26.07.2023)

- After having a few days vacation, I Completed the functionalities of the project and it's working the desired way.
- Values emiting was easier to implement into the project.
- I'm having a doubt about the UI design because the PDF design and Video design is totally different. I sent a email regrading the doubt I'm having to the Helvar team. Hope I'll get a reply. Otherwise I'm planning on doing both designs.
- I haven't done testing in cypress so I'm currently learning that to implement it.
- Also I'm building different compoents and adding them into the project so the App.js would be more cleaner.

(27.07.2023)

- Deployed the project to netlify.
- After the deployment I could see a few designs of elements are not showing properly specially the slider designs even though the functionalities are working fine.

<!-- ## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Framework of choice

Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write _something_. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.

## Optimizations

_(optional)_

You don't have to include this section but interviewers _love_ that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews!

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those _whoa this is awesome_ or _fuck yeah I did it!_ moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.

## Examples:

Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
